# CRM Tool 

This repo contains a simple Spring MVC web application that uses Hibernate to perform CRUD operations with a MySQL database. It is a Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) tool that allows a user to add, update and delete user profiles, as well as view them from the main page.

There are also API endpoints exposed under: `/api/customer`.

### Setup

This project uses an all Java configuration (no xml) for Spring and uses Maven for dependency management.
